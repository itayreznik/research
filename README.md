A few notes:
- GANLatentDiscovery is code of another repo of a GAN that I used for our milestone.
- In order to run "research_milestone2", you need to make a directory called "models" and put the "G_ema.pth" file inside the directory.
  This file is the GAN weights file that is used in GANLatentDiscovery to return an instance of the trained GAN. Then I use this instance in my "research_milestone2" code.
  I could not commit this file because it is too large, so here is a Google Drive link where you can download it:
